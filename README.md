# System Scripts

This is just a collection of scripts that may grow, unless I split them up into 
their own repos. They're intended to be little utilities I use on my system for
maintenance, bootstrapping, avoiding tedious things etc. Many of them, I
suspect, could have just been bash scripts. And if the scripts in this don't 
grow, it means they probably ended up just being bash scripts.
